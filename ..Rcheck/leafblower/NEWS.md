# leafblower (development)

## Breaking changes

* `method="ieppa"` now runs the paper-faithful algBCD (Chu, Liang, Toh &
  Yang 2022, arXiv:2011.14312) at C=0, using cell-compressed representation
  with log-space Sinkhorn factors and a capacity BCD block. The previous
  implementation was an IPF+Dykstra hybrid misnamed "iEPPA"; it is renamed
  `method="raking"`.

* New `method="raking"` exposes the renamed classical IPF+Dykstra hybrid
  (Deming-Stephan 1940 / Csiszár 1975 cyclic IPF + Boyle-Dykstra 1986
  additive projections). Same implementation as pre-rename `method="ieppa"`.

* `method="auto"` continues to route to `method="ieppa"` (now the faithful
  algBCD).

## New features

* Cell-compressed computation: faithful iEPPA operates at cell-level
  (unique (g_1,...,g_K) tuples) rather than observation-level, yielding
  up to 1000× speedup on surveys with low tuple diversity.
